# AE-Sequencer
Hi there!
Thank you for downloading my ScriptUI tool!
Sequencer is an After Effects script that lets users seamlessy distribute the layers on their timeline.

--How to Install--
To get started, all you need to do is open After Effects, go to File > Scripts > Install ScriptUI Panel and select the Sequencer.jsx file from the folder titled "AE-ScriptUI Panel"
From there, you'll have to restart After Effects, but once you do that you'll be able to access the panel from Window > Sequencer.jsx

If you're just interested in running the script, and you don't want to install a panel, you can go to File > Scripts > Run Script File... and select the Sequencer.jsx file from the folder titled "AE-Script"

--How to Use--
Sequencer allows you to easily space your layers along the timeline.
There are 4 actions this script allows for:
1. Align Selected Layers
	Aligns the in point of all the selected layers to your designated start point.
2. Sequence Selected Layers
	Sequences all selected layers one after another based on the layer's in and out points.
3. Equally Space Layers
	Sequences all selected layers to be equally spaced on the timeline.
4. Randomly Space Layers
	Randomly distributes layers along the timeline.

All of these actions begin sequencing from your designated start point. When you first launch the script, you'll see a dropdown that will let you set what the start point is. You can choose between Playhead: this will set your start point to wherever the play head is in your composition, and Composition Start: this will set your start point to the very first frame of your composition.

Lastly, for equally spacing layers and for randomly spacing layers you have a designated time to set. Do you want to span your layers across 12 frames, 2 seconds or 200 seconds? You can determine all of that in the second row of this panel.
